I have one file for submission called Cluster.py

In the Cluster.py i created a class called Cluster and two static fanctions 
  - first function is  output_into_file() , takes one arguments the list contain ouput data
  - function open file and write ouput to it as per assigment specification
  - second function main () to make object of class cluster and invoke the class

class Cluster contains :
    
    __init__() to construct class cluster 
      - field are intitialised inside this funxtion
      - takes no argument, there for defaulted consttructor
    set and get function for data manipulation and encapslation for each data field
    
    generate_new_centre(cluster, cluster_number) take cluster and cluster number
     - generate new centriod for given data (cluster) and cluster number 
     - comments on code give more details and git logs
     
    generate_new_clusters() take no argument
     - generate data point for new generated claster centriod 
     - More infor given on comments how new cluster are generated
    
     convergence() take no argument
      - check if centriod are converging 
      - at converging state of centriod data is stored about each cluster and number of iterartion
      - Refer to comments how the function check convergence
     
      output_format () take no argument 
       - formart the output of the class cluster
       - refer comments code for meore information
       
Execution : 
     - $ make                            # to build enviroment
     - $ source ./venv/bin/activate   	 # to activate virtual enviroment
     - $ make run               	 # code execution
     - $ deactivate                      # to deactivate virtual enviroment
     - $ maken clean 			 #to clean enviroment (delete virtual enviroment and output file Cluster.txt)
     - NB in my laptop i have python3 hence in my make have python3 as executor
        can use make clean command to delete text file
     - All output will be file called Cluster.txt file on current directly you run code
