Teach RL Agents to pickup packages on a grid-world. The
environment is Four-Rooms domain.

ImplementQ-learning as your RL aglorithm with the goal of teaching your agent to pickup the
package(s) in three scenarios of increasing complexity

First scenario, Agent must collect 1 package located somewhere in the environment

Second scenario, Agent must collect 3 packages located somewhere in the
environment

Third scenario, Agent must collect 3 packages located somewhere in the envi-ronment. 
These packages are marked as red (R), green (G) and blue (B) and your agent
must collect them in that order. Collecting a package in the wrong order will terminate a
simulation epoch early.

Use Make file for Running program.
